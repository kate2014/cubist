# Cubist 3D
With advances in 3D printing and 3D scanning technologies, there is an increasing number of 3D models that are being put online. The goal of this project is to develop an open source Web gallery for 3D models, allowing users to upload and download 3D models without a fee. The gallery also spots several advanced features for interacting and viewing 3D models.
